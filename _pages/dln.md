## Prompt:

> Write a 750 word reflection on digital literacy from the perspective of a 20 year old university student at a liberal arts university. Include strategies they might already know how to employ in their daily and academic lives for content creation, social interaction, as well as any platforms or software they use for research data management as well as data manipulation and analysis. Consider the different skill sets in the room given all the interdisciplinary majors ( in different fields such as Computer Science, Interactive Media, Film and New Media, Literature or Creative Writing, Art and Art History). Reflect on how digital humanities might offer new horizons on what they are studying, how collaboration might offer new avenues for developing their “computational thinking” that is in the sense of Berry and Fagerjord (A cognitive practice involving practical wisdom and reflection on computation) and how they can learn about new ways of approaching data and the world of AI. Offer critical reflection on your current abilities, what you are what you are discovering in the course as well as what kinds of new ways of thinking you would like to explore.

### A University Student’s View on Digital Literacy

As a 22-year-old university student at a liberal arts institution, I'm caught between digital skilss and critical thinking. Digital literacy goes beyound using computers or use social media—it is about understanding and questioning how these tools affect our lives in both academic and personal contexts. As technologies advances with AI and data-driven decisions, I see digital literacy isn't a fixed skill; it's constantly changing, requiring continuous learning and adaptation.

### Focused on Content Creation and Social Interaction

As an Interactive Media Arts Major, Digital literacy is central to how I create content creation and engage with others. I work with Figma and Miro for UI/UX, Unity and Maya for 3D design, and Adobe Animate for 2D animation. Recently, I’ve started exploring film production with DaVinci Resolve and camera work. While my peers in Creative Writing may publish essays on Medium platforms like Medium or Substack, and Film students focus on video editing with Adobe Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve, we all rely onRegardless of discipline, we all rely on digital tools to share our work, engage audiences, and collaborate.

Digital tools also shape how we interact socially. Platforms like Discord, Slack, and Trello help with academic teamwork, I use Google Workspace tools for documentation and collaboration, while Art History students curate digital exhibits on Google Arts & Culture. Understanding both the potentials and limitations of these platforms is key for effective communication and content creation.

### Digital Research and Data Management

Managing and analyzing research data is is key part of digital literacy. I’ve used Zotero and Github once each for essay writing and project work, but tools like Unity, Figma, and miro are central to my work as an Interactive Media Mahor  My friends in Art and Art History rely on JSTOR and Artstor for research, while those in Computer Science use GitHub for coding projects. Learning to organize and manage digital information improves research efficiency and encourages critical thinking.

Moreover, data manipulation and analysis have become integral to various disciplines. I have experimented with Voyant Tools to conduct textual analysis of literary works, uncovering hidden patterns in large corpora of texts. Meanwhile, my peers in Computer Science use Python and R for data visualization, and those in Film and New Media analyze audience engagement metrics using Google Analytics. Each discipline has its own toolkit, yet digital humanities offer a bridge between them, demonstrating how computational approaches can enrich our understanding of literature, art, and media.

### Digital Humanities and New Horizons in Learning

The field of digital humanities provides an interdisciplinary space where traditional humanistic inquiry meets computational methods. Before taking courses in digital humanities, I viewed textual analysis as a primarily close-reading endeavor. However, through exposure to machine learning models for sentiment analysis and topic modeling, I have begun to see literature not just as a collection of individual texts but as part of larger, analyzable systems. Digital humanities expand what is possible in my field, from network analysis of characters in novels to computational studies of authorship attribution.
This exposure has also deepened my understanding of computational thinking, as described by Berry and Fagerjord—not just as programming but as a cognitive practice that involves practical wisdom and reflection on computation itself. In collaborative settings, my peers and I negotiate different approaches to problems: a computer science student might suggest algorithmic sorting for a dataset, while a literature student like myself might emphasize the ethical implications of data collection. These interdisciplinary discussions challenge us to develop nuanced perspectives on digital methods, recognizing both their potential and their limitations.

### Critical Reflections on My Digital Abilities and Future Growth

Despite my growing proficiency in digital research tools, I recognize gaps in my understanding. While I am comfortable with basic text mining and visualization techniques, I would like to develop deeper expertise in natural language processing and data storytelling. AI presents new frontiers in creative writing, from generative text models to interactive storytelling experiences, and I am curious about how these tools can be critically and creatively engaged.
Additionally, I want to explore the ethical dimensions of digital work. How do biases in AI systems shape the way information is processed and disseminated? How can we ensure that digital tools do not reinforce systemic inequalities in academia and beyond? Digital literacy is not just about technical proficiency but about developing a critical lens through which to evaluate digital systems and their impact on society.

### Conclusion

As I continue my journey through university, I am excited to deepen my engagement with digital humanities and computational thinking. Digital literacy is not a static skill set but an evolving practice that requires constant learning and adaptation. By embracing interdisciplinary collaboration, critically reflecting on digital tools, and exploring new ways of approaching data, I hope to cultivate a digital fluency that is both technically sound and ethically informed. The liberal arts, with their emphasis on holistic learning, provide the perfect environment for this exploration—one where the humanities and technology do not stand in opposition but work together to enrich our understanding of the world.
