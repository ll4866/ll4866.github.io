## Prompt:

> Write a 750 word reflection on digital literacy from the perspective of a 20 year old university student at a liberal arts university. Include strategies they might already know how to employ in their daily and academic lives for content creation, social interaction, as well as any platforms or software they use for research data management as well as data manipulation and analysis. Consider the different skill sets in the room given all the interdisciplinary majors ( in different fields such as Computer Science, Interactive Media, Film and New Media, Literature or Creative Writing, Art and Art History). Reflect on how digital humanities might offer new horizons on what they are studying, how collaboration might offer new avenues for developing their “computational thinking” that is in the sense of Berry and Fagerjord (A cognitive practice involving practical wisdom and reflection on computation) and how they can learn about new ways of approaching data and the world of AI. Offer critical reflection on your current abilities, what you are what you are discovering in the course as well as what kinds of new ways of thinking you would like to explore.

### Navigating Digital Literacy as an Interactive Media Arts Student

As a 22-year-old NYU Shanghai student, balancing digital skills with critical thinking is essential to my academic and personal growth. Digital literacy goes beyond using computers or browsing social media—it involves understanding and questioning how these tools shape our lives. With the rapid advancements in AI and data-driven technologies, I've realized that digital literacy is not a fixed skill but an evolving practice that demands continuous learning and adaptation.

### The Role of Digital Tools in Creation, Collaboration, and Communication

As an Interactive Media Arts major, digital literacy is at the heart of my creative process. I use tools like Figma and Miro for UI/UX design, Unity, Rhino8, and Maya for 3D projects, and Adobe Animate for 2D animation. Recently, I’ve also been exploring film production with DaVinci Resolve and experimenting with camera work. My peers in Creative Writing publish essays on platforms like Medium and Substack, while Film students focus on video editing using Adobe Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve. Despite the varying disciplines, digital tools are crucial for showcasing work, engaging audiences, and collaborating effectively.

These tools also shape how we interact socially. Platforms such as Discord, Slack, and Trello help organize academic projects, while Google Workspace facilitates documentation and teamwork. Art History students curate digital exhibits on platforms like Google Arts & Culture, demonstrating the diverse applications of digital tools across disciplines.

### Digital Organization and Data Analysis in Research

A significant part of digital literacy is managing and analyzing research data. I’ve used Zotero for organizing citations, GitHub for version control, and Unity to prototype interactive experiences. My peers in Computer Science frequently use GitHub for coding projects, while Art History students rely on databases like JSTOR and Artstor for research. Learning to manage digital information sharpens my research skills and enhances my critical thinking.

Data analysis plays a key role across disciplines. I've used tools like Voyant Tools for text analysis, while my Computer Science peers work with Python and R for data visualization. Film and New Media students often use Google Analytics to analyze audience engagement. Additionally, my exploration of Node-RED has allowed me to manage data flows and integrate diverse datasets, enriching my understanding of data-driven decision-making.

### The Intersection of Creativity and Technology in Digital Humanities

Digital humanities merge traditional humanistic inquiry with computational methods. Initially, I saw analysis as primarily focused on close reading. However, exposure to tools like Unity, Figma, Node-RED, and programming languages like JavaScript and Python has broadened my perspective. I’ve worked with machine learning models for sentiment analysis and topic modeling, which helped me view literature and media not as isolated works but as interconnected systems. Digital humanities open up exciting possibilities in my field, from network analysis of characters to computational studies of user interaction and media design.

Spatial data analysis has also been an exciting area of exploration. For example, by creating a UFO sighting map, I’ve engaged with structured data, revealing insights into geography and social patterns. Digitization and digitalization—converting physical objects into digital formats or transforming processes through computational methods—further extend these inquiries. These experiences have deepened my understanding of computational thinking, which Berry and Fagerjord describe as thinking critically about how we use technology, not just coding. In collaborative projects, I often focus on user experience, interface design, and ethical considerations, while my computer science peers emphasize algorithmic efficiency. These diverse perspectives enhance our ability to engage critically with digital methods and produce more thoughtful outcomes.

### Building Digital Literacy and Technical Expertise
Through my digital journey, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of how digital platforms shape not only content creation but also communication and collaboration across disciplines. I’ve learned to use GitHub for managing and sharing code, giving me a clearer grasp of version control and collaborative workflows. Additionally, creating static websites on GitHub has expanded my understanding of web development and how digital platforms structure and present content. Exploring distant reading tools like Voyant and Posit Cloud has helped me analyze large bodies of text and uncover patterns that would be difficult to detect through traditional methods.

I’ve also delved into remediation—the transformation of content from one medium to another—and seen how digital technologies reshape texts and media, making them more accessible and interactive. My experiments with text processing tools and machine learning models have expanded my understanding of how machines analyze language and how text analysis can be reimagined in the digital age.

Moreover, AI tools like GPT present new opportunities in content creation and data analysis. However, they also raise important concerns about data security and privacy, especially when handling confidential information. This underscores the need for careful consideration of ethics in digital work, particularly with AI.

### Reflecting on My Digital Journey and Future Directions
As I continue to develop my digital literacy, I recognize areas for growth. Although I am comfortable with basic text mining, visualization techniques, and tools like Unity, Figma, Node-RED, and JavaScript, I want to deepen my expertise in natural language processing and data storytelling. AI’s potential in interactive media, from generative text models to immersive storytelling experiences, excites me, and I am curious about how these tools can be applied both critically and creatively.

I also want to explore the ethical dimensions of digital work. How do biases in AI systems influence the processing and sharing of information? How can we prevent digital tools from reinforcing inequalities in academia and beyond? Digital literacy isn’t just about technical proficiency; it’s about cultivating a critical perspective to evaluate digital systems and their impact on society.

### Growing as a Digital Thinker
As I continue my university journey, I am eager to dive deeper into digital humanities and computational thinking. For me, digital literacy isn’t just about mastering tools—it’s about understanding how they work, why they matter, and what I am doing when I use them. I aim to bridge the gap between tools and the thinking behind them, learning to apply them meaningfully. Whether through interactive media projects, coding experiments, or data analysis, I strive to build a digital fluency that is both technically sharp and grounded in curiosity and critical reflection. The liberal arts provide the perfect environment for this growth, where technology and the humanities converge, helping me make sense of—and reshape—the world around me.

### Exploring Digital Tools, Web Creation, and AI
In addition to my core work, I’ve recently used GitHub to create simple static websites using markdown, which enhanced my understanding of web development. This experience introduced me to website creation, hosting, and structuring content for online engagement. We also explored the distinctions between static, dynamic, and interactive websites, helping me understand how digital platforms operate based on their design and purpose. These insights are critical when selecting the right platform for specific projects.

Distant reading tools like Voyant, Posit Cloud, and Google Ngram Viewer have also helped me analyze large text corpora. By applying computational methods, I have identified patterns that traditional close reading might overlook. This exploration has led me to investigate the concept of remediation—transforming content across different media. Remediation is a crucial skill in the digital world, as it enhances accessibility and interactivity, expanding the reach of content.

Furthermore, I’ve developed my computational thinking skills by breaking down complex problems into manageable tasks. This approach has enabled me to engage more effectively with digital tools and solve problems with a structured mindset. Tools like DOT (Document Object Technology) have helped me explore offline document analysis, while corpus tools have deepened my understanding of language.

#### Addressing AI, Privacy, and Ethical Considerations
AI continues to present challenges, particularly around privacy. We discussed how AI tools like GPT may not be suitable for handling confidential data due to how they store information. This highlights the importance of considering the ethical implications of using such tools. As I continue to navigate the intersection of AI and digital tools, I’m prompted to think critically about their potential to shape society and the need for responsible use.
