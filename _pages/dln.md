## Prompt:

> Write a 750 word reflection on digital literacy from the perspective of a 20 year old university student at a liberal arts university. Include strategies they might already know how to employ in their daily and academic lives for content creation, social interaction, as well as any platforms or software they use for research data management as well as data manipulation and analysis. Consider the different skill sets in the room given all the interdisciplinary majors ( in different fields such as Computer Science, Interactive Media, Film and New Media, Literature or Creative Writing, Art and Art History). Reflect on how digital humanities might offer new horizons on what they are studying, how collaboration might offer new avenues for developing their “computational thinking” that is in the sense of Berry and Fagerjord (A cognitive practice involving practical wisdom and reflection on computation) and how they can learn about new ways of approaching data and the world of AI. Offer critical reflection on your current abilities, what you are what you are discovering in the course as well as what kinds of new ways of thinking you would like to explore.

### Navigating Digital Literacy as an Interactive Media Arts Student

As a 22-year-old student at NYU Shanghai, I’ve come to realize how essential digital literacy is in both my academic and personal growth. It's not just about using computers or social media—it's about understanding how these tools impact our lives and how we can engage with them critically. With rapid advancements in AI and data-driven technologies, I’ve learned that digital literacy is an ongoing process, always evolving as we learn new tools and techniques.

### The Role of Digital Tools in Creation, Collaboration, and Communication

Being an Interactive Media Arts major, digital literacy is central to my creative work. I rely on software like Figma and Miro for UI/UX design, Unity, Rhino8, and Maya for 3D work, and Adobe Animate for 2D animation. I’ve recently started exploring film production using DaVinci Resolve, and I’m diving into camera work too. My classmates in Creative Writing use platforms like Medium and Substack to publish essays, while Film students work with Adobe Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve for editing. Despite our different disciplines, we all rely on digital tools to showcase our work, communicate with others, and collaborate more effectively.

These tools also play a big role in how we interact socially. Platforms like Discord, Slack, and Trello are essential for organizing academic projects, and Google Workspace helps us with documentation and teamwork. I’ve noticed that even my peers in Art History are using digital tools like Google Arts & Culture to curate exhibits, showing how diverse applications of digital tech can be across fields.

### Digital Organization and Data Analysis in Research

A huge part of digital literacy is how we manage and analyze data, which has been key in my research process. I use Zotero to organize citations, GitHub for version control, and Unity to prototype interactive experiences. My peers in Computer Science also use GitHub for collaborative coding projects, while Art History students rely on tools like JSTOR and Artstor for research. Learning to organize digital information has sharpened my research skills and made me think more critically about how to approach academic work.

Data analysis is another area where digital tools are super useful across disciplines. I’ve used Voyant Tools for text analysis, and my Computer Science peers often work with Python and R for data visualization. In Film and New Media, we also use tools like Google Analytics to analyze audience engagement. Additionally, I've been experimenting with Node-RED to manage data flows, which has helped me understand how to integrate different datasets and make data-driven decisions.

### The Intersection of Creativity and Technology in Digital Humanities

Digital humanities is an exciting field that blends traditional humanities with computational techniques. At first, I thought analysis was all about close reading, but my exposure to tools like Unity, Figma, Node-RED, and programming languages like JavaScript and Python has totally changed that. I’ve worked with machine learning models to analyze sentiment and topics in text, which made me think about literature and media in a much more interconnected way. Digital humanities offer a whole new lens through which to explore my studies, from network analysis of characters to interactive design in media.

I’ve also been exploring spatial data analysis—like when I created a map of UFO sightings—and it’s opened my eyes to how data can reveal patterns and connections we might miss in traditional research. Digitizing physical objects or transforming old processes through digital tools gives new perspectives. This has all deepened my understanding of computational thinking, which, according to Berry and Fagerjord, is about thinking critically about how we use technology. When working with my peers, I often focus on user experience and interface design, while they’re looking at algorithmic efficiency, which leads to some really enriching collaborations and outcomes.

### Building Digital Literacy and Technical Expertise

Throughout my digital journey, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of how digital platforms impact not just content creation but also collaboration and communication across disciplines. I’ve learned to use GitHub for version control, which has given me a solid grasp of how code management and collaborative workflows work. Creating static websites on GitHub has also expanded my understanding of web development, and I now see how important structure and content presentation are for online engagement.

Distant reading tools like Voyant and Posit Cloud have also helped me analyze large text corpora, uncovering patterns that would’ve been difficult to spot otherwise. This exploration has led me to think more about remediation—transforming content from one medium to another. This concept is crucial in the digital age, as it makes content more accessible and interactive, reaching wider audiences.

Working with AI tools like GPT has sparked my curiosity about new possibilities in content creation and data analysis, but I’m also thinking critically about privacy and data security—especially when working with sensitive information. The ethical questions around AI and data use are something I’m really focusing on as I continue developing my digital literacy.

### Reflecting on My Digital Journey and Future Directions
As I continue to explore digital tools and technologies, I know there’s still a lot to learn. I’m comfortable with basic text mining and visualization techniques, and I’ve gained experience with tools like Unity, Figma, Node-RED, and JavaScript, but I’m eager to dive deeper into natural language processing and data storytelling. The possibilities of AI in interactive media are fascinating, especially when it comes to generative text models and immersive storytelling. I’m excited about how these tools can be used both creatively and critically.

I also want to explore the ethical side of digital work more. How do biases in AI influence the information we get? How can we ensure that digital tools don’t reinforce societal inequalities? Digital literacy is not just about learning technical skills—it’s also about cultivating a critical eye to understand the implications of these technologies.

### Growing as a Digital Thinker
As I continue my journey through university, I’m excited to delve deeper into digital humanities and computational thinking. For me, digital literacy isn’t just about mastering tools—it’s about understanding how they work and what they can do for me. I want to bridge the gap between the tools I use and the thinking behind them, learning how to apply them in a meaningful way. Whether it’s through interactive media projects, coding, or data analysis, I’m building a digital fluency that’s both technically sound and critically aware. The liberal arts environment is perfect for this—it’s where technology and the humanities come together, helping me make sense of the world in new and exciting ways.

### Exploring Digital Tools, Web Creation, and AI
Alongside my core work, I’ve recently used GitHub to create static websites using markdown. This experience not only introduced me to the basics of web development, like creating websites, hosting them, and structuring content for online engagement, but also gave me a deeper understanding of how different types of websites work. We examined the distinctions between static, dynamic, and interactive websites, which helped me grasp how digital platforms operate depending on their design and function. This knowledge is crucial when considering the right platform for different projects.

Additionally, I’ve explored distant reading tools like Voyant, Posit Cloud, and Google Ngram Viewer, which have been incredibly useful for analyzing large text corpora. By applying computational methods to text, I’ve been able to identify patterns that traditional close reading might miss. This exploration has led me to dive into the concept of remediation, which involves transforming content across various media. In the digital world, remediation enhances accessibility and interactivity, broadening the scope and reach of content—an essential skill in our media-driven landscape.

Beyond content analysis, I’ve also worked on strengthening my computational thinking skills. By breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks, I’ve been able to engage more effectively with digital tools and solve problems with a more structured mindset. For instance, tools like DOT (Document Object Technology) have helped me explore offline document analysis, while corpus tools have deepened my understanding of language processing.

#### Addressing AI, Privacy, and Ethical Considerations
AI tools, such as GPT, bring a range of challenges, especially regarding privacy.
