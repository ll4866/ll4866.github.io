## Prompt:

> Write a 750 word reflection on digital literacy from the perspective of a 20 year old university student at a liberal arts university. Include strategies they might already know how to employ in their daily and academic lives for content creation, social interaction, as well as any platforms or software they use for research data management as well as data manipulation and analysis. Consider the different skill sets in the room given all the interdisciplinary majors ( in different fields such as Computer Science, Interactive Media, Film and New Media, Literature or Creative Writing, Art and Art History). Reflect on how digital humanities might offer new horizons on what they are studying, how collaboration might offer new avenues for developing their “computational thinking” that is in the sense of Berry and Fagerjord (A cognitive practice involving practical wisdom and reflection on computation) and how they can learn about new ways of approaching data and the world of AI. Offer critical reflection on your current abilities, what you are what you are discovering in the course as well as what kinds of new ways of thinking you would like to explore.

### Navigating Digital Literacy as an Interactive Media Arts Student
As a 22-year-old student at NYU Shanghai, majoring in Interactive Media Arts, digital literacy has become an essential aspect of both my academic and personal development. Beyond the technical skills of using computers and social media, digital literacy involves understanding how digital tools impact our lives and learning to engage with them critically. The rapid advancements in AI and data-driven technologies have made digital literacy an ongoing journey of exploration and growth, constantly evolving as I learn new tools and concepts.

### The Role of Digital Tools in Creation, Collaboration, and Communication
Digital tools are at the core of my creative process. I use platforms like Figma and Miro for UI/UX design, Unity, Rhino8, and Maya for 3D modeling, and Adobe Animate for 2D animation. Recently, I've also started working with DaVinci Resolve for film production, diving into camera work. In parallel, my peers in Creative Writing and Film rely on platforms like Medium and Substack for publishing, while Film students use Adobe Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve for editing. Despite varying tools, we all rely on digital platforms for creation, communication, and collaboration.

For academic work, tools like Discord, Slack, and Trello help us organize projects, and Google Workspace allows for real-time documentation and collaboration. Even Art History students, who traditionally relied on physical archives, now use digital platforms like Google Arts & Culture to curate virtual exhibits, demonstrating the versatility of digital tools across disciplines.

### Digital Organization and Data Analysis in Research
Efficient data management and analysis are integral to my research. I use Zotero for organizing citations, GitHub for version control, and Unity to prototype interactive experiences. My peers in Computer Science frequently use GitHub for collaborative coding projects, while Art History students rely on JSTOR and Artstor for research. These tools help me organize and access data, pushing me to think critically about the role digital tools play in research.

In terms of data analysis, I’ve used Voyant Tools for text analysis, while my Computer Science peers employ Python and R for data visualization. Film and New Media students also utilize Google Analytics to analyze audience engagement. Additionally, experimenting with Node-RED has expanded my understanding of data integration and decision-making.

### Exploring Digital Humanities
Digital humanities has shown me how technology can transform the study of history. Recently, our work focused specifically on historical newspapers, as they serve as valuable public records containing extensive data on trade, transportation, climate, wave heights, and more. Unlike modern digital content, older newspapers often have complex layouts and inconsistent formatting, making data extraction challenging. However, digital tools allow us to systematically organize and analyze this wealth of information, revealing patterns that might otherwise remain hidden.

Additionally, through the NYUAD Library's Special Collections, I explored a broader range of historical media, including colonial-era maps, journals, letters, and photographs. While newspapers provide structured, data-rich content ideal for quantitative analysis, these other materials offer qualitative insights into historical narratives and perspectives. This experience reinforced the importance of digitizing diverse sources, making them more accessible, and expanding the ways we can analyze and interpret history through digital methods.

### Building Digital Literacy and Technical Expertise
Throughout my studies, I’ve gained proficiency in tools that foster both creative work and interdisciplinary collaboration. Learning to use GitHub for version control has improved my understanding of collaborative workflows, and creating static websites has deepened my grasp of web development. These experiences have shown me how crucial structure and presentation are in online engagement.

Tools like Voyant and Posit Cloud have proven invaluable for analyzing large text corpora, revealing patterns that traditional close reading might miss. This has led me to think critically about remediation—transforming content from one medium to another. In a world where content is constantly remediated, making it accessible and interactive has become essential for reaching a wider audience.

### AI Tools and Ethical Considerations
AI tools like GPT have sparked my interest in the future of content creation and data analysis. However, I am also mindful of the ethical concerns surrounding AI, particularly regarding privacy and confidentiality. While AI systems can process and generate vast amounts of information, they do not inherently record or store every message or document unless explicitly designed to do so. Nonetheless, the potential risks associated with handling sensitive data and biases within AI models remain critical issues. In our discussions, we've emphasized the importance of privacy protections and the need for transparency in AI usage. Moving forward, I plan to further explore AI’s societal impact and ethical implications.

### Exploring Digital Tools, Web Creation, and AI
In our coursework, we examined the distinctions between static, dynamic, and interactive websites, which helped me understand how digital platforms function based on their design and purpose. Tools like DOT (Document Object Technology) and corpus tools have deepened my understanding of offline document analysis and language processing.

As I continue to work with AI and other digital tools, I find myself reflecting more on their societal impact and ethical use. The growing reliance on AI in the digital humanities and beyond raises questions about bias and fairness. Understanding these challenges will be vital as I continue to develop my digital literacy.

### Reflecting on My Digital Journey and Future Directions
While I’ve become proficient in tools like Unity, Figma, and GitHub, I’m eager to explore natural language processing and data storytelling further. AI’s role in interactive media, particularly in generative text models and immersive storytelling, fascinates me. I look forward to seeing how these tools can be applied both creatively and critically.

At the same time, I’m keen to explore the ethical dimensions of digital work. How biases in AI can shape information and influence content creation is a critical issue that I aim to tackle. Digital literacy is not just about mastering technical skills; it’s about engaging critically with technology and understanding its impact on society.

### Growing as a Digital Thinker
In the future, I look forward to diving deeper into digital humanities and computational thinking. Digital literacy means not just mastering tools but also understanding how they work and how to apply them meaningfully. The interdisciplinary environment at NYU Shanghai offers the perfect opportunity to explore how technology and the humanities intersect, allowing me to make sense of the world in new and exciting ways.

By integrating digital tools into my studies, I am learning how to think critically and creatively, preparing myself for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. As I continue to expand my digital literacy, I am excited about the potential of these technologies to shape both my academic journey and the world around me.
