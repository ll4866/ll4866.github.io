This assignment focuses on personalizing a provided text to reflect my own digital literacies and the skills I aim to develop this semester. The goal is to adjust the content from my perspective, maintaining a length of around 750 words.
**Due date:** 8 February 2025.
{: .notice}

## Prompt:

> Write a 750 word reflection on digital literacy from the perspective of a 20 year old university student at a liberal arts university. Include strategies they might already know how to employ in their daily and academic lives for content creation, social interaction, as well as any platforms or software they use for research data management as well as data manipulation and analysis. Consider the different skill sets in the room given all the interdisciplinary majors ( in different fields such as Computer Science, Interactive Media, Film and New Media, Literature or Creative Writing, Art and Art History). Reflect on how digital humanities might offer new horizons on what they are studying, how collaboration might offer new avenues for developing their “computational thinking” that is in the sense of Berry and Fagerjord (A cognitive practice involving practical wisdom and reflection on computation) and how they can learn about new ways of approaching data and the world of AI. Offer critical reflection on your current abilities, what you are what you are discovering in the course as well as what kinds of new ways of thinking you would like to explore.

### A University Student’s View on Digital Literacy

As a 22-year-old university student at a liberal arts institution, I'm caught between digital skilss and critical thinking. Digital literacy goes beyound using computers or use social media—it is about understanding and questioning how these tools affect our lives in both academic and personal contexts. As technologies advances with AI and data-driven decisions, I see digital literacy isn't a fixed skill; it's constantly changing, requiring continuous learning and adaptation.

### Focused on Content Creation and Social Interaction

As an Interactive Media Arts Major, Digital literacy is central to how I create content creation and engage with others. I work with Figma and Miro for UI/UX, Unity and Maya for 3D design, and Adobe Animate for 2D animation. Recently, I’ve started exploring film production with DaVinci Resolve and camera work. While my peers in Creative Writing may publish essays on Medium platforms like Medium or Substack, and Film students focus on video editing with Adobe Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve, we all rely onRegardless of discipline, we all rely on digital tools to share our work, engage audiences, and collaborate.

Digital tools also shape how we interact socially. Platforms like Discord, Slack, and Trello help with academic teamwork, I use Google Workspace tools for documentation and collaboration, while Art History students curate digital exhibits on Google Arts & Culture. Understanding both the potentials and limitations of these platforms is key for effective communication and content creation.

### Digital Research and Data Management

Managing and analyzing research data is an important part of digital literacy. I’ve used Zotero once to organize citations for writing essays and worked with GitHub for version control. As an Interactive Media Arts major, I also use Unity to prototype interactive experiences. My friends in Computer Science use GitHub more extensively for coding projects, while Art and Art History students rely on databases like JSTOR and Artstor for research. Knowing how to manage digital information helps improve research and encourages critical thinking.

Data analysis is important across different fields. I’ve experimented with Voyant Tools for text analysis, while my peers in Computer Science use Python and R for data visualization. Film and New Media students use Google Analytics to study audience engagement. While each discipline uses different tools, digital humanities create a connection, showing how technology enhances the study of literature, media, and art.

### Digital Humanities and New Horizons in Learning

The field of digital humanities provides an interdisciplinary space where traditional humanistic inquiry meets computational methods. Before taking courses in digital humanities, I viewed analysis as primarily focused on close reading. However, as an Interactive Media Arts major, my exposure to tools like Unity, Figma, and programming languages such as JavaScript and Python has broadened my perspective. I’ve worked with machine learning models for sentiment analysis and topic modeling, which helped me see literature and media not just as isolated works but as parts of larger, analyzable systems. Digital humanities expand possibilities in my field, from network analysis of characters to computational studies of user interaction and media design.

This journey has also enhanced my understanding of computational thinking, as Berry and Fagerjord describe it—not just coding but thinking critically about how we use technology. In collaborative projects, I often bring a focus on user experience, interface design, and the ethical implications of digital tools, while my peers from computer science might focus on algorithmic efficiency. These diverse perspectives help us critically engage with the potential and limits of digital methods, fostering richer, more thoughtful outcomes.

### Critical Reflections on My Digital Abilities and Future Growth

Despite my growing proficiency in digital research tools, I recognize gaps in my understanding. As an Interactive Media Arts major, I’m comfortable with basic text mining, visualization techniques, and tools like Unity, Figma, and JavaScript. However, I’d like to deepen my expertise in natural language processing and data storytelling. AI opens new possibilities in interactive media, from generative text models to immersive storytelling experiences, and I’m curious about how these tools can be used both critically and creatively.

Additionally, I want to explore the ethical dimensions of digital work. How do biases in AI systems influence how information is processed and shared? How can we prevent digital tools from reinforcing systemic inequalities in academia and beyond? Digital literacy isn’t just about technical skills; it’s about cultivating a critical perspective to evaluate digital systems and their broader impact on society.

### Conclusion

In my university journey as an Interactive Media Arts student, I’m eager to further explore digital humanities and computational thinking. I see digital literacy as a dynamic process, one that grows through constant learning and adaptation. Through interdisciplinary projects, critical engagement with tools like Unity, Figma, and Python, and new ways of working with data, I hope to build a digital fluency that balances technical expertise with ethical awareness. The liberal arts encourage this kind of exploration, where technology and the humanities intersect to deepen our connection with the world around us.
