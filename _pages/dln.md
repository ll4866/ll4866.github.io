<summary> Prompt: </summary>
Write a 750 word reflection on digital literacy from the perspective of a 20 year old university student at a liberal arts university. Include strategies they might already know how to employ in their daily and academic lives for content creation, social interaction, as well as any platforms or software they use for research data management as well as data manipulation and analysis. Consider the different skill sets in the room given all the interdisciplinary majors ( in different fields such as Computer Science, Interactive Media, Film and New Media, Literature or Creative Writing, Art and Art History). Reflect on how digital humanities might offer new horizons on what they are studying, how collaboration might offer new avenues for developing their “computational thinking” that is in the sense of Berry and Fagerjord (A cognitive practice involving practical wisdom and reflection on computation) and how they can learn about new ways of approaching data and the world of AI. Offer critical reflection on your current abilities, what you are what you are discovering in the course as well as what kinds of new ways of thinking you would like to explore.*

### Navigating Digital Literacy as an Interactive Media Arts Student
As a 22-year-old student at NYU Shanghai majoring in Interactive Media Arts, digital literacy is central to both my academic and personal development. It’s not just about knowing how to use computers and social media—it’s about understanding how digital tools shape the way we think, create, and interact. With AI and data-driven technologies evolving rapidly, digital literacy has become an ongoing process of exploration and adaptation as I learn new tools and concepts.

### The Role of Digital Tools in Creation, Collaboration, and Communication
Digital tools are at the core of my creative process. I use Figma and Miro for UI/UX design, Unity, Rhino8, and Maya for 3D modeling, and Adobe Animate for 2D animation. Recently, I’ve been exploring DaVinci Resolve for film production and camera work. Meanwhile, my peers in Creative Writing and Film rely on Medium and Substack for publishing, while Film students use Adobe Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve for editing. Despite our different disciplines, we all depend on digital platforms for creation, communication, and collaboration.

For academic work, tools like Discord, Slack, and Trello help us manage projects, while Google Workspace enables real-time documentation and teamwork. Even in fields like Art History, where physical archives were once dominant, students now curate virtual exhibits using platforms like Google Arts & Culture, demonstrating how digital tools shape research and creative practices across disciplines.

### Digital Organization and Data Analysis in Research
Efficient data management is crucial to my research. I use Zotero for organizing citations, GitHub for version control, and Unity to prototype interactive experiences. My peers in Computer Science rely on GitHub for collaborative coding, while Art History students use JSTOR and Artstor for research. These tools not only help organize data but also push me to think critically about the role of digital systems in knowledge production.

When it comes to data analysis, I’ve worked with Voyant Tools for text analysis, while my Computer Science peers use Python and R for data visualization. Film and New Media students leverage Google Analytics to study audience engagement. Experimenting with Node-RED has also given me a better grasp of data integration and decision-making workflows.

Recently, I’ve been working on extracting data tables from the Zanzibar Gazette newspaper and converting them into structured CSV files. This involves using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to recognize and extract tabular data while ensuring accuracy. The project has made me more aware of the challenges of working with historical materials—especially how inconsistent formatting and OCR errors can disrupt structured data. It has also reinforced the importance of refining workflows and selecting the right tools for effective data transformation.

### Exploring Digital Humanities
My work with digital humanities has shown me how technology can transform historical research. Recently, we focused on historical newspapers as records of trade, climate, and transportation data. Unlike modern digital content, older newspapers have complex layouts and inconsistent formatting, making data extraction challenging. However, digital tools allow us to systematically organize and analyze these records, revealing patterns that would otherwise be difficult to detect.

Through the NYUAD Library’s Special Collections, I explored a range of historical media—colonial-era maps, journals, letters, and photographs. Newspapers provide structured, data-rich content ideal for quantitative analysis, while these other materials offer qualitative insights into historical narratives. This experience reinforced the importance of digitizing diverse sources and expanding digital methods in historical research.

It also made me reflect on computational reading versus traditional close reading. Distant reading techniques allow us to process thousands of texts at once, revealing broad patterns, but they shift our engagement with meaning—favoring data-driven insights over deep contextual understanding. This tension between scale and nuance is something I want to explore further, particularly as I continue working with OCR correction and structured data analysis.

### Building Digital Literacy and Technical Expertise
Through my studies, I’ve developed skills that support both creative work and interdisciplinary collaboration. Learning GitHub for version control has refined my understanding of collaborative workflows, while building static websites has deepened my grasp of web development. These experiences have shown me how important structure and presentation are in digital spaces.

A key area I want to explore further is efficient ways of extracting information and transferring data across different media. Whether it’s working with OCR to digitize historical texts or automating data processing, refining these skills will allow me to work more effectively with large datasets and diverse sources.

At the same time, I’ve started questioning the role of making versus maintaining in digital work. I tend to focus on the outputs I create, but I’m beginning to see the value in processes that don’t always produce tangible products—like data curation, ethical AI design, and knowledge organization.

### AI Tools and Ethical Considerations
While I’ve developed proficiency in Unity, Figma, and GitHub, I’m eager to explore natural language processing and data storytelling further. I’m particularly fascinated by AI’s role in interactive media, especially in generative text models and immersive storytelling. At the same time, I want to think critically about the ethical dimensions of digital work.

Beyond acquiring technical skills, I want to explore computational thinking in relation to phronesis—practical wisdom gained through experience rather than algorithms. As I continue learning, I hope to not just understand how digital tools work, but how they shape knowledge, interpretation, and preservation.

### Exploring Digital Tools, Web Creation, and AI
In our coursework, we explored static, dynamic, and interactive websites, which helped me understand how digital platforms function based on design and purpose. Tools like DOT (Document Object Technology) and corpus analysis tools have deepened my understanding of offline document processing and language analysis.

As I continue working with AI and other digital tools, I’ve been thinking more about their societal impact and ethical considerations. The increasing reliance on AI in digital humanities raises questions about bias, accessibility, and fairness. Understanding these challenges will be crucial as I develop my digital literacy further.

### Reflecting on My Digital Journey and Future Directions
While I’ve developed proficiency in Unity, Figma, and GitHub, I’m eager to explore natural language processing and data storytelling further. I’m particularly fascinated by AI’s role in interactive media, especially in generative text models and immersive storytelling. At the same time, I want to think critically about the ethical dimensions of digital work.

Beyond acquiring technical skills, I want to explore computational thinking in relation to phronesis—practical wisdom gained through experience rather than algorithms. As I continue learning, I hope to not just understand how digital tools work, but how they shape knowledge, interpretation, and preservation.

### Growing as a Digital Thinker
Looking ahead, I want to dive deeper into digital humanities and computational thinking. Digital literacy isn’t just about mastering tools—it’s about understanding their implications and applying them meaningfully.

By integrating digital tools into my studies, I’m learning to think critically and creatively, preparing myself for the challenges and opportunities ahead. As I continue expanding my digital literacy, I’m excited about how these technologies will shape both my academic journey and the broader world around me.
