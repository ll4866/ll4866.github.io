# Title
This exercise has three main elements:
1. choosing a corpus of three texts (or three sets of texts) you would like to work with
2. using digital textual analysis tools to see what kind of exploratory data analysis (EDA) you can do using that corpus,
3. assembling the evidence in a piece of web-facing written work along with visuals.
