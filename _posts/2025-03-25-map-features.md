Previously, we explored various map projects, examining their uses, purposes, and potential applications. To delve deeper into the technical aspects of map creation, we began working with map features. We specifically explored [OpenStreetMap’s features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features) and were curious about replicating similar functionalities in our own maps.

Using [Overpass Turbo](https://overpass-turbo.eu/) , we generated queries with prompts like “Write an Overpass Turbo query for amenity = (desired feature).” The resulting data was exported as a JPEG and imported into [Kepler](https://kepler.gl/demo) for visualization.

For my exploration, I focused on São Paulo, my birthplace. Initially, I mapped cinemas across the city, but with only a few points appearing, the data felt insignificant. I then switched to mapping bars, knowing that drinking culture is popular in Brazil. The results revealed a significantly higher number of bars, highlighting their prominence in the city.
