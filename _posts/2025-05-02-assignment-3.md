## Introduction
*Written and researched by Lucas Lin.*

This assignment explores how well AI can recognize and classify different qualities in cat images generated by other AIs on CIVITAI. By analyzing how well AI models can identify predefined attributes such as Realistic, Artistic, Surreal, Humorous, and Abstract, we aim to assess the accuracy and reliability of these models in interpreting visual data. This not only evaluates the technical performance of AI but also explores the broader implications of AI-driven image classification in the context of digital content creation.

## 1. Building the Corpus
### 1.1 Corpus Desciption
* **Source:** Generated AI Images from CIVITAI, a site where people share and download AI models.
* **Number of Images:** 99
* **Number of Images with Prompt:** 67
* **Attributes:** Realistic, Artistic, Surreal, Humorous, Abstract (only tagged on images with prompts)
* **Organizaiton:** Everything’s sorted into folders named after those five categories.

### 1.2 Data Gathering
I used the IMAGE DOWNLOADER extension to pull 99 of the latest AI-generated cat images from CIVITAI *(from May 1, 2025)*. The default weekly filter gave me a good slice of what’s trending right now. After that, I went back manually and checked each one for its prompt, writing them down if they existed—super important for what comes next.

### 1.3 Organizing Corpus
To give the analysis some structure, I sorted the images into five main styles: Realistic, Artistic, Surreal, Humorous, and Abstract. I didn’t pick these out of nowhere. I asked KIMI to read all the prompts and suggest category sets a few times, then chose the one that made the most sense. I let KIMI guide the classification because I wanted to lean into the logic of the machine—categorizing more from the prompt’s perspective than my personal interpretation of the images. Here's the gist of each category:

1. **Realistic and Photorealistic**: Focused on cats that look super lifelike—clear textures, natural lighting, that sort of thing.

2. **Artistic and Illustrative**: More expressive images—painterly, stylized, or visually interpretive with less emphasis on realism.

3. **Surreal and Fantasy**: Weird, dreamy, exaggerated—images that feel like they come from an alternate universe.

4. **Humorous and Meme-like**: Light-hearted and playful, sometimes outright absurd. These are designed to entertain.

5. **Abstract and Minimalist**: Simpler, more symbolic compositions. Think shapes, colors, forms—less about representing reality.

Because I wanted to evaluate how AI understands and responds to prompts, organizing images by prompt made more sense than sorting purely by visual traits.

## 2 Clustering Exercise (Organe Data Mining)
### 2.1 Different Algorithms Clustering
To begin, I clustered the images without their labels—just to see how the algorithm would naturally group them. This follows what Impett and Offert (2024) talked about: when you're reading a corpus through a neural net, you're also kind of letting the machine read it back to you.

Here are some snapshots of what came out of that:

| Cluster Screenshot | Algorithm |
|-------------------|-----------|
| ![This is Cluster Guess 0](/assets/images/assignment-3/ClusterGuess0.png)| `Inception V3`|
| ![This is Cluster Guess 1](/assets/images/assignment-3/ClusterGuess1.png)| `SqueezeNet`|
| ![This is Cluster Guess 2](/assets/images/assignment-3/ClusterGuess2.png)| `Painters` |
| ![This is Cluster Guess3](/assets/images/assignment-3/ClusterGuess3.png)| `DeepLoc` |

What I noticed:

* `Inception V3` Seemed to pick up on object likeness—e.g., black cats were often grouped together.
* `SqueezeNet` Organized more by thematic cues—narrative elements, context, or tone.themes.
* `DeepLoc` Prioritized light and color distribution. Darker images were clustered toward the top left, lighter ones toward the bottom right.
* `Painters` Focused on type and color palette—essentially a visual art-style clustering.

Each clustering algorithm “read” the images differently. These patterns echoed Impett and Offert’s point: different models carry different cultural biases and logics. It’s not about right or wrong—it’s about recognizing that what a model notices says something about its architecture and training history.

## 3 Classification & Consfusion Matrix
### 3.1 Categorizing Images
As previously mentioned, I developed a classification system based on the attributes: Realistic, Artistic, Surreal, Humorous, and Abstract. These categories were determined by analyzing the prompts of the images with the assistance of KIMI.

### 3.2 Prediction
I anticipated that the AI would accurately identify some classifications, given that the images were generated based on specific descriptive wording. However, the results did not fully meet my expectations, as the AI's classifications were inconsistent and did not clearly identify some categories.

### 3.4 Result
|**A. Inceptionv3**||
|--|--|
|![This is Hierchy 1](/assets/images/assignment-3/Hierchy0.png)|![This is Issue 1](/assets/images/assignment-3/Issue0.png)|
|![This is Evidence 1](/assets/images/assignment-3/Evidence0.1.png)| C1. Most Surreal Fantasy but it seems that it attempted to categorize by how solid the color or texture is in this cluster| 
|![This is Evidence 2](/assets/images/assignment-3/Evidence0.2.png)| C2. Artistic illustrative is the most in this cluster but what the algortithm did was cluster the more animalistic playful images in this cluster| 
|![This is Results 0](/assets/images/assignment-3/Results0.png) | `Inception V3` did a better job recognizing abstract stuff, but really struggled with identifying humor, surreal elements, and artistic styles.|

> `Inceptionv3` was able to tell playful and serious apart, but struggled to match my defined categories.

|**B. SqueezeNet**||
|--|--|
|![This is Hierchy 1](/assets/images/assignment-3/Hierchy1.png)|![This is Issue 1](/assets/images/assignment-3/Issue1.png)|
|![This is Evidence 1.1](/assets/images/assignment-3/Evidence1.2.png)| C1: Captured dramatic lighting well, but didn’t recognize the artificial or staged quality.|
|![This is Evidence 1.2](/assets/images/assignment-3/Evidence1.3.png)|C2: Did well with Artistic—most grouped images had detailed eyes/hair and self-portrait energy.| 
|![This is Evidence 1.3](/assets/images/assignment-3/Evidence1.1.png)|	C3: Grouped anime/manga styles together—though these were actually intended to be Realistic based on prompt. Suggests a different idea of “realism.”| 
|![This is Results 1](/assets/images/assignment-3/Results1.png) | `SqueezeNet` performed better than `Inception V3`, especially in identifying thematic and visual traits across most categories. Still had issues with nuance in artistic categories.|

> This model clustered by shared traits and atmosphere. Not perfect, but closer to my expectations.

|**C. Painters**||
|--|--|
|![This is Hierchy 2](/assets/images/assignment-3/Hierchy2.png)|![This is Issue 2](/assets/images/assignment-3/Issue2.png)|
|![This is Evidence 2.1](/assets/images/assignment-3/Evidence2.1.png)| C1: Capture a Anime-style digital art with realistic details|
|![This is Evidence 2.2](/assets/images/assignment-3/Evidence2.2.png)|C2: Features creative cat like images that are not common sense, plaing around with merging cat with another feature.| 
|![This is Results 2](/assets/images/assignment-3/Results2.png) | `Painters` does a better job in distinguishing between realistic Photorealistic and surreal fantasy. While the other types it does not do a great job.|

> `Painters` model performs well in identifying anime-style digital art with realistic elements, as well as imaginative, non-literal cat depictions—such as cats creatively merged with other features or environments. This strength is particularly evident in the Surreal and Fantasy category, where Painters excels at capturing the visual essence and conceptual playfulness of the style. However, the model struggles to clearly distinguish between other styles, such as Realistic/Photorealistic and Abstract/Minimalist. This indicates that while Painters is effective at recognizing stylized or fantastical imagery, it needs improvement in parsing the more nuanced or overlapping characteristics of other artistic categories.

|**D. DeepLoc**||
|--|--|
|![This is Hierchy 3](/assets/images/assignment-3/Hierchy3.png)|![This is Issue 3](/assets/images/assignment-3/Issue3.png)|
|![This is Evidence 3.1](/assets/images/assignment-3/Evidence3.1.png)| C1: Cute ;ight colored cat images with a deep story vibe to them|
|![This is Evidence 3.2](/assets/images/assignment-3/Evidence3.2.png)|C2: Playful variations of the cat. Dark color like a poster for display.| 
|![This is Results 3](/assets/images/assignment-3/Results2.png) | In terms of average it does a much better job than the other algorithms. It has more balanced results with no weakness.|

> `DeepLoc` does not exhibit any major weaknesses, suggesting a robust and consistent algorithmic approach to recognizing diverse visual styles. Its performance stands out for being steady and well-rounded rather than excelling only in specific areas.

Upon reviewing the classification results, several insights emerged:

- **Algorithm Performance**: The performance of the algorithms varied significantly. While SqueezeNet showed a strong ability to identify thematic elements and common traits, Inceptionv3 struggled with accurate categorization based on the predefined attributes.
- **Misclassification Accuracy**: The AI's ability to accurately classify images into the established categories was inconsistent. Some images could be considered for multiple categories but were placed in one due to the AI's interpretation.

### 3.4 Reflection
Upon reviewing the classification results, several insights emerged:

- **Performance Varies**: SqueezeNet was more aligned with the prompt-based categories. Inceptionv3 didn’t pick up on thematic or narrative elements as well.
- **Category Boundaries Are Fuzzy**: The prompts themselves sometimes contained hybrid or complex descriptions. AI struggled most when an image embodied more than one attribute. The categories I used weren’t always easy to separate cleanly—many images could reasonably fit into more than one. This overlap may have confused the models, but that wasn’t necessarily a flaw in their design. My main goal wasn’t perfect classification—it was to explore how different AI systems perceive, interpret, and organize creative outputs, even when the boundaries are fuzzy.
- **AI Sees Differently**: Some classifications were “wrong” by prompt label but “logical” when considering visual similarity. That’s telling.

Example:

|Image | Prompt|
|---|---|
| ![This is Image 66](/assets/images/assignment-3/images/IMAGE66.jpeg)**Category:** *Realistic and Photorealistic*| raw analog candid grainy photo 3 cute fluffy kitten/spider hybrids with fluffy spider legs (no paws), ultra high definition, on a cosy room bed, sunny morning light, we can see a human hand like a pov from the bed, one of the hybrids is climbing on the hand while other climb the bed, its a pov from me waking up so we can see the raw form of the body under the blanket, the room seems to be of a goth teem from the 90's|

The image and prompt often feel like two entirely separate entities. One opens a world of interpretation and imagination, while the other imposes a frame or limit. A single description can lead to many different visual outcomes, just as a single image can inspire countless interpretations. Ideally, you’d expect a basic alignment between what a prompt describes and what the image delivers—but that’s not always the case.

For instance, the AI might classify an image with a clearly fantastical prompt as “realistic” because it’s reading the visual style rather than the concept. It focuses on lighting, texture, resolution—things that signal photographic realism—even if the content itself (like a cat with dragon wings) is entirely fictional. The AI reads “realness” as a surface quality, not a thematic one.

This shows a fundamental split in how the AI processes data: when categorizing, the model leans on textual information, using keywords to identify the intended style. But when clustering, the model works visually, grouping based on form, color, and visual similarity—not on what the image is “about.”

This difference reveals a core challenge in machine vision: the gap between semantics (meaning) and aesthetics (appearance). As Arnold and Tilton argue in Distant Viewing, computational methods can analyze large image corpora efficiently, but interpretation still depends heavily on context. Our results echo that—AI can sort images by how they look, but it struggles with how they mean.

Ultimately, while AI models have become skilled at recognizing visual features, they’re still developing an understanding of how visual content and textual intent relate. There’s a gap between prompt and picture, between description and depiction. Until models can bridge that gap—understanding both what is seen and what is meant—their classifications will remain just approximations of human interpretation.

## 4 Multimodal Analysis (CLIP/DV Explorer)

### 4.1 Generate Captions
Using distant viewing tools, I analyzed a series of AI-generated images by inputting prompts into image generation models, then comparing the AI-predicted captions (from models like CLIP) to the original prompts. Additionally, I applied Image Classification (referencing section 2.3) to compare the predicted categories to the intended content and visual themes of the images.

#### Observations: 
* **Caption Mismatch:** Most of the AI-generated captions failed to accurately reflect the complex and nuanced content described in the prompts. For example, highly stylized or conceptual images were often reduced to overly simplistic descriptions like "a cat and a dog" or "a woman with a cat on her head."

* **Category Prediction Inconsistencies:** The image classification often focused on superficial elements (e.g., “sandal,” “church,” “electric fan”), ignoring more semantically relevant content. This suggests that models still struggle with context recognition, especially in stylized or surreal images.

* **Semantic Blindness in Stylized Content:** The AI's failure was most evident in anime or fantasy-style images, where specific details—like character design, pose, environment, or emotional tone—were critical to the meaning. Models prioritized generic or misclassified elements, overlooking key narrative signals. Analyze 1–2 examples where AI failed to recognize cultural cues (e.g., a "catgirl" classified generically as "woman").

* **Surprising Results:** Some classifications (e.g., "spider web," "comic book") revealed latent pattern biases in the dataset used to train the model, highlighting how irrelevant features can dominate AI perception.

This analysis shows that while multimodal tools like CLIP can offer surface-level understanding of image content, they often lack sensitivity to aesthetic style, narrative intention, and prompt complexity—especially in art or stylized images. This gap reveals current limitations in AI's ability to semantically align image content with prompt-driven intent, particularly in non-photorealistic domains.

### 4.2 DV Explorer Zero-Shot Test 
To further evaluate multimodal alignment, I tested a subset of images using DV Explorer’s Zero-Shot Classification tool with the same category labels (Realistic, Artistic, Surreal, Humorous, Abstract). The results revealed significant disparities in model performance:

This demonstrates that the model excels at detecting overt visual markers of realism or fantasy but struggles profoundly with culturally nuanced or conceptually abstract categories. The results align with Distant Viewing's observation that AI systems often recognize 'what' is depicted more readily than 'how' or 'why'—prioritizing literal features over stylistic intent or emotional resonance. Particularly telling is the humor detection failure, suggesting the model lacks training in internet meme semiotics where absurdity and irony dominate. These limitations expose how even multimodal models remain constrained by their training data's cultural priorities and object-centric biases.

Interestingly, most of the cartoon-style images are positioned in the “real” category rather than being labeled as “artistic,” which challenges the common assumption that drawings are inherently artistic. Image 6 and Image 19 stand out as neither realistic nor artistic—Image 19 appears artificial and puppet-like, which may contribute to its lack of realism or artistic value, while Image 6, although clearly a cartoon, lacks the expressive or stylized qualities typically associated with artistic depictions. Notably, all the cat images are consistently rated as realistic, perhaps due to the model’s training data containing many cat photos or because cats are relatively easy to render believably. In contrast, images categorized as artistic tend to exhibit dramatic shifts in style, vibrant color contrasts, or unique visual palettes that set them apart from both realistic and cartoon imagery.

### 5 Overall
### 5.1 Summary
This assignment has provided a comprehensive examination of AI's ability to recognize and classify attributes of AI-generated cat images sourced from CIVITAI. By analyzing how well AI models can identify predefined attributes such as Realistic, Artistic, Surreal, Humorous, and Abstract, we aimed to assess the accuracy and reliability of these models in interpreting visual data. This study not only evaluates the technical performance of AI but also explores the broader implications of AI-driven image classification in the context of digital content creation.

### 5.2 Key Insights
The analysis has revealed several key insights into the capabilities and limitations of AI in image classification and caption generation:

- **Algorithm Performance**: Different algorithms showed varied levels of performance in classifying images based on their attributes. Some algorithms were more effective at identifying thematic elements and common traits, while others struggled with accurate categorization based on predefined attributes.
- **Misclassification Accuracy**: The AI's ability to accurately classify images into the established categories was inconsistent. Some images could be considered for multiple categories but were placed in one due to the AI's interpretation.
- **Understanding of Stylized Content**: The AI's failure was most evident in anime or fantasy-style images, where specific details—like character design, pose, environment, or emotional tone—were critical to the meaning. Models prioritized generic or misclassified elements, overlooking key narrative signals.
- **Semantic Blindness**: The AI's failure to accurately reflect the complex and nuanced content described in the prompts indicates a semantic blindness in stylized content. The models often struggled with context recognition, especially in stylized or surreal images.
- **Bias in Dataset**: Some classifications revealed latent biases in the dataset used to train the model, highlighting how irrelevant features can dominate AI perception.

### 5.3 Takeaway
The findings from this assignment suggest that while AI has made significant strides in image recognition and classification, there is still considerable room for improvement, particularly in how AI interprets and categorizes visual data based on textual descriptions and cultural contexts.

This analysis, combined with insights from Distant Viewing (Arnold & Tilton), suggests that while AI has made significant progress in image classification, the journey towards AI that can truly understand and interpret visual culture is ongoing and requires further refinement and understanding of the nuances in visual data.
