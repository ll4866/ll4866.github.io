## Introduction
*Written and researched by Lucas Lin.*

Summary What this assignment is about: This assignment is I would be constructing an Image Dataset and using Orange Data Mining and the DV Explorer to analyze it, work with materials and algorithms discussed in class. Its focus is to explore a custom-made corpus of digital images and write this small critical essay about my findings about it. 

## 1 Image Corpus
### 1.1 Select Cultural Domain
The corpus I have selected are images from CIVITAI, is a website that allows users to share and download AI models particularly those used for image generation, I wanted to explore how well the algorithms do with clustering and classifying AI images if the images produces by the AI were accurate or not... I looked at cat images with the most reaction recently by week on May 1...
### 1.2 Data Gathering
I dowloaded the first 98 images 
### 1.3 Organizing Corpus
Rename files systematically by what method

## 2 Clustering Ecercise (Organe Data Mining)
### 2.1 Different 
Use the provided images2.ows workflow and test clustering with Inceptionv3 and other algorithms.
How does one built-in algorithm such as Inceptionv3 in ODM cluster the data?
Do other algorithms give you different results?
What features seem to be most characteristic of the different quadrants of the image plot?
Using hierarchical clustering, isolate specific clusters to look more closely.
How “in reading a corpus of visual culture through a neural network, [are you] always also doing the reverse?” (Impett and Offert, 2024)
### 2.2 Analysisng the Results
Screenshot the main image plot;

Method explain how Isolate clusters via hierarchical clustering; annotate findings.

Reflect: How does the algorithm’s view differ from yours?
### 2.1 Comparison Insights
Compare algorithm outputs.

Address the Impett & Offert quote on neural networks.

## 3 Classification & Consfusion Matrix
### 3.1 Categorizing Images
Creating clssification system
### 3.2 Preditiong
What to expect 
Analysing any errors that occured and why
### 3.3 Reflection
Refine categories if needed.
How well did any of the built-in algorithms you chose predict the categories you established?
Did you go back and adjust any of your categories?
When you isolate the cases of “false positives”, i.e. mis-predictions, can you understand why the algorithm got them wrong? (Think about the Monet/Manet mis-prediction case we saw in class).
If you could train your own algorithm what would you aim to teach it?
Reference Distant Viewing (Arnold & Tilton).

## 4 Multimodal Analysis (CLIP/DV Explorer)
### 4.1 Generate Captions
Use 2DCLIP/DV Explorer to auto-caption images. Compare AI-generated text to my own interpretations.
### 4.2 Explore Language-Image Relationship
Try to decipher how CLIrganize the corpus. Revisit the Impett & Offert quote in this context.

## 5 Overall
### 5.1 Summary
Summarize findings from Parts 2–4.
### 5.2 Key Insights
### 5.3 Takeaway
